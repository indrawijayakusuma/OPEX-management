# Project Name: OPEX Monitoring and Management

## Description

The **OPEX Monitoring and Management** project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing Operational Expenditure (OPEX) using various technologies such as Spring, MySQL, Thymeleaf, JPA Hibernate, Apache POI, and Spring Security. The goal of this project is to help businesses track and optimize their operational expenses efficiently.

The application offers a user-friendly web interface built with Thymeleaf for easy navigation and interaction. It leverages the power of Spring, Spring Security, and JPA Hibernate to ensure a robust and secure backend. The data is stored and managed in a MySQL database, while Apache POI is utilized for generating reports and exporting data.

## Features

- **OPEX Data Management:** The project provides functionality to manage operational expenses, including creating, editing, and deleting expense records.
- **Reporting and Export:** Apache POI library is integrated to generate reports and export data in various formats, such as Excel spreadsheets.
- **Data Persistence:** JPA Hibernate is used to interact with the MySQL database, providing efficient and reliable data persistence.
- **User Interface:** Thymeleaf, a popular server-side Java template engine, is employed for building a dynamic and responsive web interface.
